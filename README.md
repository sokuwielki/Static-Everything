# Static Toolkit Hub 

A versatile collection of client-side, fully portable web applications designed for speed, privacy, and zero reliance on a backend server.
Every tool is a single, self-contained $\text{HTML}$ file, making the entire hub easy to save, share, and run instantly, even offline.

##  Core Idea: Pure Client-Side Utility

The user should be able to download any app page and run it locally with $100\%$ functionality.

Zero Dependencies: No external JavaScript or CSS frameworks (like CDNs) are required at runtime. All styles and scripts are inlined.

Zero Backend: All logic, calculations, and data persistence (via Local Storage) happen exclusively within the user's browser.

No API Usage: The project contains zero network requests to external APIs, ensuring complete privacy and stability.
